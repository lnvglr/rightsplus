title: Your Rights
lead: According to the EU Air Passenger Rights Regulation, you have the right to compensation under certain conditions.

If you have experienced a delay of more than three hours upon arrival, a flight cancellation, or an involuntary rebooking, you are often entitled to a standard compensation of €250 to €600—regardless of the ticket price or travel class.

Even if your employer paid for the flight, you personally have the right to compensation. However, there are exceptions if a different agreement was contractually made with the employer.

You also have the right to food, free phone calls and emails, and, in certain cases, a hotel stay and airport transfer. You can claim compensation for incidents up to 3 years in the past.

The Air Passenger Rights Regulation applies to all flights departing from or arriving in the EU and to flights within Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland, provided that the airline is based in the EU.

### The amount of compensation depends on the flight distance to the final destination and is as follows:

	:::

	:::
::

The compensation amount does not depend on the price of the flight ticket or the travel class. You are entitled to compensation provided certain conditions are met, including having a confirmed booking and being present for check-in at the scheduled time.

In certain cases, your right to compensation may be waived. For example, if the airline can prove that the cancellation or delay was due to extraordinary circumstances, such as airport closures, bird strikes, or severe weather, and that all reasonable measures were taken to prevent the delay or cancellation. Your right is also waived if the airline informed you of the cancellation at least two weeks before the scheduled departure or, in the case of short-notice changes, provided an adequate alternative.

Your right to claim compensation can be applied retroactively for up to 3 years from the end of the year in which it arose. Thus, claims from 2022 and subsequent years will not expire until 31.12.2025.
