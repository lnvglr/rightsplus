title: Our Team
lead: "Our strong team: Ready for your passenger rights, anytime!"
---

As a young and highly motivated team, we have set ourselves the goal of supporting passengers in enforcing their rights in air traffic. We have recognized that many compensation claims exist under the Passenger Rights Regulation, but are often not claimed by passengers. After many client conversations, we have noticed that many passengers are particularly deterred by the costs and process risks. Therefore, we have decided to provide relief and offer our comprehensive service package from RIGHTS PLUS, to take away these concerns from passengers.
