## 1. General
::indented-list
1.1 The collection services and the services on the website [www.rightsplus.de](http://www.rightsplus.de) are provided by RIGHTS PLUS - Joachim Bawa, Zülpicher Platz 18, 50674 Cologne (hereinafter referred to as "RIGHTS PLUS").

1.2 The following regulations apply to all services and declarations of intent provided and issued by RIGHTS PLUS.

1.3 RIGHTS PLUS does not provide legal advice.

## 2. Subject of the Contract
::indented-list
2.1 RIGHTS PLUS takes on the purely success-based enforcement of claims arising from REGULATION (EC) No. 261/2004 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of February 11, 2004, on a common system of compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights and related claims (hereinafter referred to as "Claim") against an airline.

2.2 RIGHTS PLUS asserts claims against airlines from assigned rights in its own name out of court. If the claim cannot be enforced in this way, RIGHTS PLUS will engage its contractual lawyers.
::

## 3. Assignment of Claims & Conclusion of Contract
::indented-list
3.1 The content of RIGHTS PLUS on the website [www.rightsplus.de](http://www.rightsplus.de) (or other RIGHTS PLUS pages) as well as in the compensation calculator does not yet constitute a binding offer for the conclusion of a contract.

3.2 The customer makes a binding offer to conclude a contract / fee-based service contract for the enforcement of the claim along with ancillary claims by clicking on "Order Now" at the end of the compensation calculator and signing the assignment of claims. RIGHTS PLUS accepts the offer through an explicit declaration (e.g., by email or sending the signed assignment declaration) or by asserting the claim against the airline. The request for further information or documents for the examination of the claim does not constitute an acceptance declaration.

3.3 The customer assigns all claims and rights that he has against the respective airline under Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004 in connection with a flight event under a specific booking reference to RIGHTS PLUS with an electronic or handwritten signature.

3.4 The customer declares that he is legally capable and entitled to dispose of the assigned claim. If the customer asserts claims on behalf of other persons, he also guarantees that he is authorized to dispose of these additional claims.

3.5 RIGHTS PLUS may refuse to take over the compensation claim if, after examination from the perspective of RIGHTS PLUS, the claim does not exist or is not enforceable, or if the collection of the claim would entail an unjustifiable economic and/or time-consuming effort for RIGHTS PLUS. The customer will be informed of a rejection. The customer has no right to a justification for the rejection.

3.6 RIGHTS PLUS endeavors to enforce the claim against the airline. The customer has no claim to judicial enforcement. If RIGHTS PLUS comes to the conclusion that judicial enforcement does not offer sufficient prospects of success, the customer will be informed of this, and the claim will be reassigned to him. The reassignment is carried out using a reassignment form. With the reassignment, the contractual relationship expires.

3.7 The contractual relationship ends with the forwarding of the partial payment by the airline to the customer or when the hopelessness of collection is determined and the customer is informed of this. The assessment of hopelessness is at the discretion of RIGHTS PLUS, provided that a proper examination is conducted. If the claim is not enforceable, the contract ends with a final judgment or the reassignment of the claim.

3.8 Furthermore, the contractual relationship can be terminated by both parties for good cause. A good cause exists in particular if the customer has made false statements to RIGHTS PLUS or has not submitted all requested information or documents within a reasonable period.
::

## 4. Compensation
::indented-list
4.1 In the event of successful enforcement of the claim, RIGHTS PLUS receives a proportional fee in the amount of the agreed percentage. Reference is made to the price list in this regard. The prerequisite for the creation and due date of the fee is generally that the claim is successfully collected. A deviation from this applies if RIGHTS PLUS offers the immediate purchase option and the customer chooses this. In this case, the requirement for successful collection is waived.

4.2 Once the contract is concluded, the fee claim of RIGHTS PLUS arises when the airline pays the customer, which is derived from the price list. This claim arises regardless of whether the payment is made due to the efforts of RIGHTS PLUS or the customer in cooperation with RIGHTS PLUS. The customer is obliged to inform RIGHTS PLUS immediately about the receipt of payment and to pay the part corresponding to the fee claim of RIGHTS PLUS immediately to it. An invoice will be issued to the customer in this regard.

4.3 If only a partial amount of the claimed amount is enforced, the fee will also be calculated only with regard to the enforced partial amount. The same applies in the case of a settlement with the airline according to Section X.

4.4 If the efforts of RIGHTS PLUS are not successful, the customer will incur no costs. This also applies if the contractual lawyers were involved in enforcing the claim. The above does not apply if the customer acts in breach of duty. In this regard, reference is made to Section 6.

4.5 According to § 13e RDG, the customer can claim the costs that RIGHTS PLUS charges him for the performance of its services from his debtor only up to the amount of the fee as damages, which would be due to a lawyer for this activity according to the provisions of the Lawyer's Remuneration Act.
::

## 5. Payments
::indented-list
5.1 The payment of the reimbursement amount is made exclusively to the person who signed the assignment agreement. The customer is liable for all costs that may arise in connection with the payment of the compensation payment. With the payment of the customer's share of the claim, all claims of the customer against RIGHTS PLUS from the contract are finally settled.

5.2 If the customer has provided incorrect or incomplete bank details, so that a performance-releasing payment of the compensation amount by RIGHTS PLUS is not possible, the customer bears the costs incurred to determine the correct or complete bank details.

5.3 Any interest that may arise will not be paid to the customer by RIGHTS PLUS. There are no interest payments for the time between incoming and outgoing payments. RIGHTS PLUS is entitled to claim any interest payments received from the airlines for RIGHTS PLUS. The customer also has no claim to a payment of other fees, costs, and interest to be reimbursed by the airline, which RIGHTS PLUS has advanced or has been entitled to claim from the airline.

5.4 RIGHTS PLUS is not liable for damages of any kind and of any amount that arise from a payment to the customer being prevented or delayed by an event that is not under the reasonable control of RIGHTS PLUS but is due to force majeure. This includes, in particular, strikes, lockouts, labor disputes, force majeure, war, riots, civil unrest, malicious damage to property, accidents, failure of facilities or machinery, fire, flooding, storms, and compliance with legal regulations.

## 6. Obligations of the Customer
::indented-list
6.1 The customer undertakes to provide all information completely, properly, and truthfully and to correct it if circumstances change or if he finds that he has made false statements. He is obliged to cooperate comprehensively at all stages. He provides RIGHTS PLUS with all documents/information required for processing (in particular boarding passes, other flight evidence, and his own correspondence with the airline) and submits new information unsolicited and without delay. The customer is responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the documents/information. The customer is obliged to provide any necessary supplementary information immediately upon request.

6.2 The customer assures that he is the owner of the claim in question or is entitled to dispose of it. He assures that the claim has not already been asserted or that payments or offsetting payments have been made. This also applies to payments made by the tour operator. He also assures that no third party has also been commissioned with the enforcement and that during the commissioning of RIGHTS PLUS, he does not independently engage any other service providers, lawyers, or private or public entities (e.g., the SÖP) to represent his interests and does not independently initiate legal proceedings and conduct a lawsuit regarding the claim. He also assures that he will not conduct separate negotiations with the airline or otherwise dispose of the claim. Furthermore, the customer assures that he will not accept any vouchers or other (partial) services without coordination with RIGHTS PLUS.

6.3 If the customer's statement as a witness is required in a civil proceeding, he does not claim reimbursement of expenses from RIGHTS PLUS.

6.4 If the claim cannot be enforced for reasons that lie in the person or behavior of the customer, or if he makes erroneous or false statements against better knowledge, the parties agree on a flat processing fee of €85 plus any legal and court costs.

6.5 The assertion of further damages – in particular in the context of a lawsuit – remains reserved. The customer is free to prove a lesser damage.

6.6 The customer's liability is excluded as long as he has made all statements truthfully and comprehensively.

6.7 If the airline approaches the customer again after the offer declaration or offers him a voucher, a check, a credit note, or something similar, the customer is obliged to inform RIGHTS PLUS immediately and to forward what he has received. RIGHTS PLUS also receives the agreed fee in this case.

6.8 The customer must provide his account details in SEPA format (IBAN, BIC) and confirm them upon request. If a transfer is made to an account that cannot be assigned to the customer due to the provision of incorrect account details, there is no claim for a repeated payment of the purchase price.
::

## 7. Engagement of Contractual Lawyers, Cost Indemnification
::indented-list
7.1 As a legal service provider, RIGHTS PLUS is not permitted to represent before the ordinary civil courts in Germany. If the out-of-court enforcement efforts (including a court dunning procedure) are completely or partially unsuccessful, RIGHTS PLUS may engage a contractual lawyer in its own name and at its own cost risk to enforce the claim (i.e., if our efforts are unsuccessful, RIGHTS PLUS bears all costs).

7.2 The customer allows RIGHTS PLUS to grant the contractual lawyer access to the documents/information. The customer undertakes to answer inquiries from the contractual lawyer regarding the facts directly.

7.3 If the enforcement of the claim is also unsuccessful after the engagement of the contractual lawyer and out-of-court and possibly also judicial enforcement, RIGHTS PLUS will indemnify the customer from the costs of engaging the contractual lawyer. RIGHTS PLUS also assumes other costs of legal enforcement (including court costs, opposing lawyer's fees, and any additional costs incurred at international jurisdictions) if these are not reimbursed by the airline.
::

## 8. Judicial and Extrajudicial Settlements
::indented-list
8.1 The conclusion of a judicial or extrajudicial settlement may also occur solely with the consent of RIGHTS PLUS for process-economic reasons to avoid cost risks. The customer will be informed of the reasons. Only if an extrajudicial or judicial settlement is also concluded with the consent of RIGHTS PLUS will the additional costs incurred by the conclusion of the settlement be borne by RIGHTS PLUS. If the airline pays only a part of the compensation claim due to the concluded settlement, the commission due to RIGHTS PLUS will be calculated solely from the portion paid by the airline as a result of the settlement.

8.2 During or after the initiation of legal proceedings, the client is only entitled to conclude an irrevocable settlement, to revoke a settlement concluded with the consent of RIGHTS PLUS, to waive the claim, to withdraw a lawsuit, or to otherwise dispose of the claim with the consent of RIGHTS PLUS. RIGHTS PLUS expressly reserves the right to reject any settlement proposal without justification.

8.3 If the customer concludes a judicial or extrajudicial settlement regarding the compensation claim without the consent of RIGHTS PLUS, which also leads to a partial or complete assumption of the customer of court costs or costs of the engaged lawyers, the customer must bear these costs himself, as the customer violates his obligations under the contract without coordination with RIGHTS PLUS. The fee owed to RIGHTS PLUS, which is derived from the price list, is due and payable regardless of the actual payment to the customer.
::

## 9. Warranty/Liability
::indented-list
9.1 RIGHTS PLUS assumes no warranty for the accuracy and completeness of the data and information provided by the customer. Otherwise, the statutory provisions regarding the warranty of RIGHTS PLUS apply.

9.2 Claims for damages due to breach of duty and from tort are excluded both against RIGHTS PLUS and against its agents and vicarious agents. This limitation of liability does not apply if the damage was caused intentionally or through gross negligence, as well as in the case of the violation of essential contractual obligations, meaning those obligations whose fulfillment enables the proper execution of a contract in the first place, on whose compliance the customer may regularly rely, and whose violation jeopardizes the achievement of the contractual purpose. The limitation of liability also does not apply to damages resulting from injury to life, body, or health if RIGHTS PLUS is responsible for the breach of duty. The limitation also does not apply to damages based on the absence of a guaranteed property or for which liability is provided under the Product Liability Act.

9.3 Until the acceptance declaration, claims for damages due to the expiration of the claim are excluded.

9.4 RIGHTS PLUS cannot be held liable for damages due to expiration or lost payments if the customer has been informed about the futility of pursuing the case or if the contract has been terminated.

## 10. Right of Withdrawal and Withdrawal Instruction

If you are a consumer within the meaning of § 13 BGB, meaning a natural person who concludes a legal transaction for purposes that are predominantly not attributable to his commercial or self-employed professional activity, you have a statutory right of withdrawal, which we inform you about as follows:

### Withdrawal Instruction
**Right of Withdrawal**
You have the right to withdraw from this contract within 14 days without giving any reason. The withdrawal period is 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract (in the sense of Section 3.1), but at the latest upon receipt of this withdrawal instruction. To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must inform us:
RIGHTS PLUS
Joachim Bawa
Zülpicher Platz 18
50674 Cologne
Tel.: XXX
E-Mail: info@rightsplus.de
by means of a clear declaration (e.g., a letter sent by post, fax, or email stating your case number) about your decision to withdraw from this contract. You can use the attached sample withdrawal form (below), but it is not mandatory.
To comply with the withdrawal period, it is sufficient that you send the notification of the exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period expires.

### Consequences of Withdrawal
If you withdraw from this contract, we will reimburse you for all payments we have received from you, including transfer fees (except for the additional costs resulting from your choice of a method of payment other than the SEPA transfer we offer), without delay and at the latest within 14 days from the day on which we received the notification of your withdrawal from this contract. For this reimbursement, we will use the same means of payment that you used for the original transaction, unless expressly agreed otherwise with you; in no case will you be charged any fees for this reimbursement.
If you requested that the service should begin during the withdrawal period, you must pay us a reasonable amount that corresponds to the proportion of the services already provided up to the point at which you inform us of the exercise of the right of withdrawal regarding this contract compared to the total scope of services provided for in the contract.

### Special Notes
Your right of withdrawal expires prematurely if the service has been fully provided by us and the execution of the service has begun only after your express consent and you have confirmed your knowledge before the execution of the service that you lose your right of withdrawal upon full performance of the contract by us.
If you want to withdraw from the contract, you can fill out this form:

## 11. Final Provisions
::indented-list
12.1 The law of the Federal Republic of Germany is applicable. This also applies to the assignment contract between the consumer and RIGHTS PLUS. If the customer has placed the order as a consumer and has his habitual residence in another country at the time of his order, the mandatory legal provisions applicable in that state shall also apply.

12.2 If the customer is a merchant and has his registered office in Germany at the time of the order, the exclusive jurisdiction is the seat of RIGHTS PLUS in Cologne. Otherwise, the applicable legal provisions apply to local and international jurisdiction.

12.3 There are no oral side agreements. Amendments to the contract as well as deviating or supplementary individual contractual regulations to this contract require written form for their effectiveness. This also applies to the waiver of the written form clause.

12.4 Should individual provisions of these General Terms and Conditions be wholly or partially ineffective or void, or become wholly or partially ineffective or void due to a change in the legal situation or through higher court rulings or in any other way, this does not affect the validity of the General Terms and Conditions in other respects. The effective and enforceable provision that comes closest to the economic objective pursued by the parties with the ineffective or unenforceable provision shall replace the ineffective or unenforceable provision. The same applies in the event of a regulatory gap.
